<p>All attendees must wear a mask at the conference venue. Masks may be removed while eating and drinking.</p>

<p>Attendees may provide their own mask, or use a mask provided by the conference. Conference staff may ask you to replace a mask if the mask considered not complying with our policy.</p>

<p>And speakers may remove their mask when giving a talk during their session.</p>

<p>Masks have to cover your nose and mouth. Face shields, bandannas, and masks with ventilation are not allowed. We encourage use of disposable masks instead of reusable ones and you may be asked to replace if you&rsquo;re using a reusable one.</p>
