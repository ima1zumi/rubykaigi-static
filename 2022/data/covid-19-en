<h2 id="positive-case-reports-during-conference">Positive case reports during conference</h2>

<p>We plan to announce existence of positive cases and possible close contacts on <a href="https://twitter.com/RubyKaigi">Twitter</a>, and relevant Email list as soon as we acknowledge them. People who tested positive or identified as a close contact, are not allowed to enter the venue.</p>

<p>Unless we&rsquo;re instructed to cancel the in-person conference from government agency, or the venue, we plan to continue the conference normally.</p>

<p>If we need to cancel the in-person conference, we would switch the conference to full-virtual and the further access to the venue would be restricted to the speakers and conference staff. And we don&rsquo;t refund any tickets for this case.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-tested-positive-or-identified-as-a-close-contact">If you tested positive, or identified as a close contact</h3>

<p>Please report to <a href="mailto:2022@rubykaigi.org">2022@rubykaigi.org</a>. We never share the details of the case to other attendees. The only exception is the requests from government agencies; see below.</p>

<p>Note that we don&rsquo;t allow people who tested positive or a possible close contact, and we&rsquo;ll offer partial refund for them.</p>

<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>

<h2 id="non-japan-based-attendees">Non Japan based attendees</h2>

<p>First of all, we really hesitate to say this, but: we don&rsquo;t recommend attending RubyKaigi 2022 in-person, from abroad.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll have a virtual venue and full live stream coverage, please register yourself as a virtual attendee instead of in-person attendee.</p>

<p>Because Japanese government maintains strict border restriction policy and changes in the policy can happen suddenly, including visa. Entry to Japan can be restricted at any time.  Thus it is not recommended to plan visiting the conference from abroad early, as of this writing.</p>

<p>However, we don&rsquo;t decline entry of people coming from abroad as long as they are complying with this policy and the government quarantine policy; and due to the govermental restriction, we can&rsquo;t sponsor Japanese visa for attending RubyKaigi 2022 in-person. If you plan to attend from abroad, please be aware of this situation.</p>

<h3 id="travel-advise-as-of-28-july">Travel Advise as of 28 July</h3>

<p><strong>Everyone without a residential visa or Japanese passport are still difficult to enter Japan.</strong>   We had expected the governmental restriction would be relaxed in July, but unfortunately the restrictive policy is still in effect; including suspension of visa waiver program. Refer to <a href="https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/border_newentry.html">https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/border_newentry.html</a> about the current procedure for new entries of foreign nationals.</p>

<p>The current policy for people without a residential visa or Japanese passport (&ldquo;foreign nationals&rdquo;) requires: Obtaining short-term visa, and applying to ERFS system <a href="https://entry.hco.mhlw.go.jp/">https://entry.hco.mhlw.go.jp/</a>. A Japanese legal entity must submit ERFS application to become a <em>receiving organization</em> who are required to own responsibility of applicants&rsquo; whole travel in Japan, including ensuring compliance with the government&rsquo;s COVID-19 related policies.</p>

<p>While we&rsquo;re disappointed on the current government policies, we again regret to say this: <strong>we lack bandwidth to support this for all attendees travelling from abroad.</strong> We&rsquo;re currently exploring a way to support this for our speakers for RubyKaigi 2022 and will make an announcement soon.</p>

<h2 id="violation">Violation</h2>

<p>Violations against this policy, including failure to comply, may result into a ban from the conference venue or decline of entry. We do not refund any ticket even in case of policy violation.</p>

<h2 id="revision">Revision</h2>

<ul>
<li>6 September 2022: Several updates.

<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ll do daily temperture check for all attendees.</li>
<li>Clarified that we encourage use of disposable masks than reusable ones. You may be asked to replace with a disposable one if you&rsquo;re using it.</li>
<li>#rubykaigiB will work as a overflow session room when necessary.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>28 July 2022: Lifted the vaccination requirement; Added the travel guide from abroad;  Noted the temperture check may be conducted.  Reasons of lifting;

<ul>
<li>We initially declared the strict policy as it is uneasy to tighten after opening the registration.</li>
<li>This requirement is now considered uneffective and useless while it involves complex process on onsite registration; Effectivity of vaccination are decreasing due to time and appearance of new variants. We also had believed updated version of vaccines for the latest variants of COVID-19 to come and/or wide availability of 4th shot, but both didn&rsquo;t happen.</li>
<li>However we still recommend all attendees to take vaccines.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>17 May 2022: Approved COVID-19 vaccine information has been updated, aligning with government policy; <a href="https://corona.go.jp/package/assets/pdf/jimu_foreign-governments_sesshureki_20220404.pdf">https://corona.go.jp/package/assets/pdf/jimu_foreign-governments_sesshureki_20220404.pdf</a> and <a href="https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/000901651.pdf">https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/000901651.pdf</a></li>
