                          Jpmobile is a Rails plugin for Japanese mobile phones. This plugin features the ability to convert Japanese emoticons and Japanese kanji codes, and session management for mobile phones which can't handle HTTP cookies. In this talk, I will introduce how we rebuilt the jpmobile codebase to support Rack applications such as Rails 3 and Sinatra.

                        Feels Like Ruby
                        <span>
                          For a Rubyist, writing Javascript is the worst part of working on a Ruby web application. Those clean, modern UIs are often made possible by incredibly complex Javascript. The helpers inevitably get in the way, and you end up writing most of it by hand.

                          It is painful.

                          But you can make writing Javascript code feel more like writing Ruby code. I will show techniques that go beyond "unobtrusive" and turn Javascript into a first-class citizen in your Ruby application. Make your Javascript more joyful!

                          The Nasu area is located in an only 150km north direction from Tokyo. Nasu is Tochigi-ken Nasushiobara city formally. 'to' of toTuby is 'To' of Tochigi-ken. Now, we are having programming and a discussion using the book of Mr. Masatoshi Seki's dRuby. Please look at http://pub.cozmixng.org/~the-rwiki/rw-cgi.rb?cmd=view;name=toRuby for details. (This page is Japanese only.) Moreover, also about the contents of our event performed by RubyKaigi, we are going to notify in the above-mentioned website. Thank you.

                          The meeting of the IT system engineer to think that I earn money seriously.

                          I raise awareness of the money, and it is a meeting of the people who want to become the engineer who can earn one's convincible income. I take up marketing and a business trend or a topic about the money that it is not readily possible for in a topic about economy in tax or assets use in the normal technology system study society how I cut one's skill efficiently in imitation Ta'izz.

                          I've written "a lot of code":http://github.com/geemus, both hobby and work, over the last year, and looking back I can't help but think that writing code for yourself is easy; it's writing code for others can be tough. In this session, I'll share some examples of good and bad practices gathered in my years writing code and libraries, and discuss how to get past being too close to the problem. I'll talk specifically about growing your work into something anybody (and hopefully everybody) will use.

                          The real time web is not about adding chat on your website. It's not really about having stock tickers. The most interesting aspect of the realtime web is to be found in augmenting the web that we already know. We can add realtime functionally to our applications as another layer of fidelity.
                          This is our story (New Bamboo, London, UK) of experimenting various real time web technologies and coming up with our own solutions (http://www.pusherapp.com). This is not about explaining how to use our solutions, but about sharing exciting opportunities and new technical challenges HTML5 WebSocket brings when you build real time web.

                          Rubygems has served the community well for many years. However, as applications become more and more complex, certain problems arise. Bundler was created to solve some of those problems and has been evolving rapidly based on community feedback. It's time to look at the current state of affairs and think about Rubygems 2.0. What parts of bundler could be moved upstream and what problems remain to be solved?

                          When building an application it is easy to forget that most applications today are available globally and used by people who speak many languages. You may create user interface in English or Japanese, but people may choose to type their data in their native language. Web browsers will allow people to enter text in almost any script, and if you are lucky it will "just work" ... but often it needs a little more attention. Sarah will share anecdotes from her adventures building Mightyverse, a multi-lingual database of native language video recordings. She will highlight details of how to get unicode text in and out of a database well as how to handle multibyte text in Ruby.

                        Truth and Consequences: Handling Ruby 1.9 Encodings in Rails
                        <span>
                          Ruby 1.9 adds support for many different encodings, making it possible to write Ruby web programs that can handle non-English characters well. However, these changes have had many consequences. At the beginning, the new encoding support has introduced much confusion in simple, English-only Rails applications and applications relying heavily on Unicode. Yehuda will explain the common problems caused by the changes, talk about what Rails has done to eliminate many of them, and what the Ruby community can do to make writing internationalized programs easier.

                        The basis of making DSL with Ruby
                        <span>
                          Ruby is well known as a language with which you can create your own DSL easily. Making DSL with Ruby is really easy, but there seem to be many developers who have not tried to make DSL with Ruby by design. In my opinion, there is no clear boundary between 'Useful APIs' and DSL. However, we can always judge whether a code is like DSL or not, that means, we can create DSL by design. In this talk, I'll start by looking into what DSL is and when to use it. After that I'll talk what concepts, habits and techniques you need to make your own DSL, showing typical examples from famous DSL codes like Rails, RSpec and so on.

                        <span>
                          There are many Ruby/Rails conferences, "RubyKaigi"s and Ruby/Rails meetups throughout the world, but we can only participate in a few of these. I'd like to use the "Lightening Talk" style to introduce some of the people running these other meetups. You may learn about a new meetup to visit, or give you ideas for your own m0eetup.

                        Best Imitation of Your Class
                        <span>
                          Ruby's open classes contribute to extensibility of applications such as Ruby on Rails. However, they sometimes cause serious conflicts between class extensions. This talk illustrates problems of open classes, and propose a resolution by which classes can be refined locally.

                            Keywords: selector namespace, classbox, context-oriented programming

                          Programming for fun, or having fun programming. Ruby is the best language for both! Let's talk about programming after we've punched out from work, the programming we can do while drinking a beer, and the programming we can do to make our friends laugh. We'll take a look at projects built for fun, as well as projects built to have fun! We'll dissect them to figure out what makes them tick, then
                          extract techniques that we can use with our day to day tasks.

                          start to struggle to make it real, that means, write codes. The main topics will be supporting Rails 3.0+ and Ruby 1.9, building Rack middleware.

                          Anyone who wants to contribute to jpmobile should attend this Kaigi.

                        Mapping the world with DataMapper
                        <span>
                          Ubiquitous computing has opened the door to two new revolutions, data collection and data manipulation. Mobile phones, digital cameras, low cost electronics, and wireless internet access have made it possible to collect data any time, anywhere. But what are we doing with the data once it's collected? How do we navigate the oceans of data we generate daily? Where can we find a Rubyist's tools for data mining and manipulation? We'll discuss how to use DataMapper, a Ruby data access library, to make sense of data of all kinds.

                          It's JRubyKaigi for people who love JRuby, by JRuby core developers and Japanese JRuby developers. This kaigi will make both people who like JRuby already or not love JRuby much more. It will contain great sessions; the keynote session by Thomas E.Enebo(@tom_enebo) and Charles O.Nutter(@headus), the invited talks by Yoshiharu Hashimoto(@hasssie), Hiroshi Nakamura(@nahi), Takeru Sasaki(@urekat), Koichi Fujikawa(@fujibee), Yoko Harada(@yokolet). We also have 10 lightning talks. You can check out details of talks on JRubyKaigi 2010 web site.

                          During RubyKaigi, you'll find tons of foreign Ruby Stars and Book writers here in Tsukuba. Why don't we directly tell them our questions, requirements, and of course, our deep appreciation, since these days are only once a year and are a very special chance for us. OK, of course we're all willing to tell them, but we know it's very hard to do so. We can hardly distinguish who's who, maybe we lack the courage to talk to them, especially when there's a language barrier between us. So, Asakusa.rb are producing a special event which aims to help introduce everybody to one another and facilitate communicate. We're having live discussions with, for example,
                              the creators of Rails 3, the author of "The Passionate Programmer", guys from the crazy "Ruby Brigade" Seattle.rb, and lot of other foreign super Ruby Stars who are sticking around here. C'mon everybody, let's get together and talk about "your" Ruby!

                          Let's trade pubkeys! A key signing party is a get-together of people who use the PGP encryption system with the purpose of allowing those people to sign each others keys. Key signing parties serve to extend the web of trust to a great degree.

                        The Necessity and Implementation of Speedy Tests
                        <span>
                          Your project's software practices are deteriorating every minute the developers wait for slow tests to finish. Once developers get fed up and stop running the tests, disregard for failing builds can't be far behind, and from there it's only a short leap to the albatross of a brittle/irrelevant test suite. Luckily this can all be avoided by adopting some time-saving testing standards and practices.

Coding together can help us bridge the artificial boundaries created by language, culture, and distance, and can create friendships that last beyond the conference.

                        Vim
                        <span>
                          About half of Rubyists are using Vim to code Ruby. Vim is one of the ultimate tools for software developments, which vary among programmers. Why don't you exchange the ways you use Vim?

                          For example, I am using some Vim plugins such as quickrun.vim, neocomplcache, and smartchr.vim to code Ruby efficiently. Although my ~/.vimrc is less than just 3000 lines, there are plenty of good tricks worth telling to you. I'd like to tell you about my Vim knowledge, and learn how you yourself are optimizing Vim.

                          I'd like to make the event in English, because most Japanese have already been learning English for a while. Of course, attendees are supposed to be familiar with Ruby and Vim, because they are the lingua franca of this event. I can help translating Japanese to English or English to Japanese. Even if you don't have a lot of confidence with other languages, you can still attend this event.

                          Other editor users such as Emacs users also can attend this event. In general, tech religious wars are fun.

                          Do you have a solid, full coverage integration test suite? You should. It is the final automated point of assurance that what you are about to push to production is not going to blow something up and cost your or your client money. I show how to integration test a real Rails application, demonstrating best practices you can apply to any setup and the latest technologies for fully covering your app, including javascript!

                        <span>
                          Cucumber is a very nice testing framework. But the major feature, execute natural language text as tests, varies from familiar "Ruby syntax". Therefore, you may feel inhibited to take the first step (so I was.). In this sub-event, we try Cucumber to build a simple Rails application. It will tell you that cucumber is not so difficult to start and has great power to describe software test.

                        Ruby API is Improved Unix API
                        <span>
                          Ruby's library API is like Unix's API, but improved. Ruby tries to fix some of the problems in Unix's API. For example, non-blocking IO in Unix is provided by setting a flag when opening a file, making it difficult to specify non-blocking behavior for individual operations. Ruby overcomes this problem by providing non-blocking methods such as #read_nonblock.

                          Another example is the fork() system call, which has problems in multi-threaded environments. Ruby provides the #spawn method as an alternative way to launch processes safely.

                          This presentation will discuss techniques for API problem discovery with more examples of Ruby's improvements over Unix's API and other problematic parts of Unix which Ruby may improve in the future.

                        A Metaprogramming Spell Book
                        <span>
                          When I started to learn Ruby, I was awed by the code of experienced rubyists. That code was full of amazing magic tricks that I could barely understand. People called those tricks "metaprogramming".

                          With time, I found that metaprogramming sits right at the core of Ruby. To think in Ruby, I had to understand all those scary tricks! Feeling like a sorcerer's apprentice, I set out to write a Spell Book of metaprogramming techniques. Once I'd finished the Spell Book, metaprogramming didn't seem like black magic anymore. Instead, it just felt like any other set of techniques.

                          In this talk, I'll show you the content of my Spell Book, so that you don't have to go through the trouble of writing one yourself.

                          I taked over the maintainer of the bigdecimal standard library in the beginning of this year. Today, the bigdecimal library has some problems in its behaviors, such as interacting convention with any other number classes. In this presentation, I will demonstrate these problematic behaviors and express their appropriate characteristics in the next version of Ruby. Additionally, I will discuss the number system which the future version of Ruby, that is 2.0, should have.

                          Ruby has library to manage LDAP, such as "Ruby/LDAP", "Net::LDAP" and "ActiveLdap". Unfortunately, no found enough documentation on the internet to determine library which is better.

                          This session introduce case of each library for Ruby community to determine for choosing which library.

                        The last decade of RWiki and lazy me
                        <span>
                          On August 31st, 2000, A slightly unusual Wiki was introduced on ruby-list. It was [ruby-list:24661] The first practical dRuby application, RWiki.

                          RWiki is strongly opinionated software. RWiki was introduced as an demonstration of the usage of various Ruby libraries, but its unique implementation also reflects the author's opinion. The most significant feature of RWiki is that it is an in-memory application that contains both the database and objects all in a single process. Which is rather reminiscent of some recent buzzwords: NoSQL and In-Memory.

                          A couple days after this presentation, RWiki will celebrate its tenth year anniversary. I am currently running several active RWiki sites. These sites have over 30 thousand pages with a process size exceeding 1Gb. In this presentation, I will tell a little story of how these RWiki sites achieved scale and volume.

                        How Did Yarv2llvm Fail
                        <span>
                          Yarv2llvm is a translator which converts instruciton set of VM of CRuby (aka YARV) into llvm. The feature of yarv2llvm is to use the type inference for raising the execution efficiency of generated llvm. Yarv2llvm get a results. For example it executes the program for computing fibonacci number 40 times faster than Ruby1.9. But it was clarified to be able not to convert all Ruby programs into llvm well either though it had expected beforehand. I will show the example of programming Ruby that cannot be converted with yarv2llvm well and the settlement plan. In addition I will introduce the outline of the next generation translator (ytl) that I am developing to support all specification of Ruby.

Why don't we directly tell them our questions, requirements, and of course, our deep appreciation, since these days are only once a year and are a very special chance for us. OK, of course we're all willing to tell them, but we know it's very hard to do so. We can hardly distinguish who's who, maybe we lack the courage to talk to them, especially when there's a language barrier between us. So, Asakusa.rb are producing a special event which aims to help introduce everybody to one another and facilitate communicate. We're having live discussions with, for example, the creators of Rails 3, the author of "The Passionate Programmer", guys from the crazy "Ruby Brigade" Seattle.rb, and lot of other foreign super Ruby Stars who are sticking around here. C'mon everybody, let's get together and talk about "your" Ruby!

                          We will focus on these 3 points:

                          ・Ruby; the value proposition for COOKPAD
                          ・How we scale and develop COOKPAD
                          ・COOKPAD from the eyes of non-Japanese engineers

                          The slides will be in English, and the lecture will be given in
                          Japanese, so non-Japanese are more than welcome to participate.

                        <span>
                          This talk explains about rurema-search, Ruby reference manual in Japanese search Web application, and how to create rurema-search. Rurema-search uses Ruby 1.9.1 (MRI) as a Ruby interpreter, groonga as a full-text search engine and data store and rroonga as a Ruby-groonga interface. Those technologies are particularly explained in 'how to create rurema-search' time.

                        How To Create A Beautiful Template Engine Which Never Breaks HTML
                        <span>
                          One of the biggest challenges in modern web application development is the difficulty of collaborating with web designers. For example, eRuby requires Ruby code to be embedded inside template files, often resulting in broken HTML designs, making life difficult for web designers. To solve this problem, various template engines which don't break HTML have been created. The trade off of these template engines, however, is that they sacrifice other features such as performance or usability.

                          In this session, a template engine that doesn't break HTML while also  preserving performance and usability will be introduced. This session  will also explore a variety of problems relating to template engines, such as the problems with techniques used in existing template engines, and whether simple "not breaking" HTML designs is sufficient.  This will be definitive session about template engines for web application development. If you are interested in web design, you must attend this session.
